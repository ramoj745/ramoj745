### Hi there, I'm Ram! ðŸ‘‹
<hr>

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m not working on any projects at the moment, but plan to start one after learning more about JavaScript.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning JavaScript and will soon dive into Node.js, Express, and React. I'm also planning to incorporate my existing knowledge in Python with backend development.
- ðŸ’» I currently have experience with: HTML, CSS, Flexbox, Grid, Bootstrap, and Python.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to work large codebases to gain experience in collaborative work environments.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with expanding my skills in JavaScript, backend development, and full-stack project setups.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I also do music production aside from web development! :)
