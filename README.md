### Hi there, I'm Ram! ðŸ‘‹
<hr>

- ðŸ”­ Currently working on a new project, a twitter-like site complete with frontend and backend functionalities, with database implementation.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about backend tech, Node.js, and Express. I'm also planning to incorporate my existing knowledge in Python with backend development.
- ðŸ’» My current tech stack: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, Bootstrap.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to work on large codebases to gain experience in collaborative work environments.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with expanding my skills in JavaScript, backend development, and full-stack project setups.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I also do music production aside from web development! :)
