### Hi there, I'm Ram! ðŸ‘‹
<hr>

- ðŸ”­ Working on <a href="https://github.com/ramoj745/consolify">Consolify: Your GitHub stats, served in a terminal.</a>
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about backend tech, Node.js, and Express. I'm also planning to incorporate my existing knowledge in Python with backend development.
- ðŸ’» My current tech stack: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, Bootstrap, ExpressJS, NodeJS, and MongoDB.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to work on large codebases to gain experience in collaborative work environments.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with expanding my skills in JavaScript, backend development, and full-stack project setups.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I also do music production aside from web development! :)
